                                Chaat, a traditional savory snack sold by street vendors in India that originated in the country’s northern region and is now popular throughout South Asia and at Indian restaurants worldwide.
                                Aloo tikki, a type of chaat.
                                Chaat is an umbrella term for a wide range of roadside foods that usually feature some kind of fried dough with various ingredients that typically create a spicy, tangy, or salty flavour, though some chaat are sweet. Papri chaat (or papdi chaat) is crispy fried-dough wafers served with typical chaat ingredients such as chickpeas, boiled potatoes, yogurt sauce, and tamarind and coriander chutneys; it may also contain pomegranate seeds and sev (noodles made from fried gram flour). Aloo tikki is a golden fried-potato patty that is often stuffed with peas or dal and served with a variety of spicy chutneys and sometimes chickpeas, while aloo chaat is simply boiled potatoes that are cubed, fried, seasoned, and served hot.
